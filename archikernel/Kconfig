			This option forces system to use system's firmware only if it's

	config ARCHIKERNEL_TARGET_SYSTEM_HAS_NO_ZRAM_GOVERNOR
		bool "System does not have ZRAM governor"
		depends on ZRAM_FOR_ANDROID
		default y if !ARCHIKERNEL_TARGET_SYSTEM_SAMSUNG
		help
			Recently Samsung modified ZRAM implementation for their closed-source
			zram solution in stock ROMs.
			The side effect is the fact that ZRAM is not anymore controlled by the
			kernel, but by the binary. Since we don't have this binary on AOSP ROMs,
			kernel is not swapping anything, even when zram or swap file is enabled.
			This option will turn off all breaks and returns added by Samsung to the
			original source. This is absolutely required for AOSP ROMs, and may be
			required also for stock ROMs, if they want to use kernel-based swap.

			Enable the identity transformation for graphite. For every SCoP we generate the polyhedral

				This option runs the standard link-time optimizer. When invoked with source

	config ARCHIKERNEL_OPTI_FUNSAFE_LOOP_OPTIMIZATIONS
		bool "Assume that loop indices do not overflow"

		bool "Perform loop invariant motion on trees"
		help
			Perform loop invariant motion on trees. This pass moves only 
			invariants that are hard to handle at RTL level (function calls,
			operations that expand to nontrivial sequences of insns). With 
			-funswitch-loops it also moves operands of conditions that are 
			invariant out of the loop, so that we can use just trivial
