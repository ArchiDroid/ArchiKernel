config LGE_GRAM_REFRESH_PATCH
	bool "LGE gram refresh patch"
	default n
	help
	  This patch is added for gram-embedded device like mddi.
	  because, when suspend state, power of mddi is off usually,
	  gram of DDI chip has garbage data until data of gram is refreshed.
	  this can cause displaying broken screen in time of turning backlight on.
	  for preventing this problem, add refreshing routine before turning 
	  backlight on by using late resume mechanism.

config LGE_BDI_TIMER_BUG_PATCH
	bool "LGE bdi timer bug patch"
	default n 
	depends on MACH_LGE
	help
	  This patch is added for preventing from kernel panic which is
	  generated during executing bdi_writeback_thread(). Root cause of
	  this kernel panic starts from the synchronization problem between
	  kernel threads. When mmc card is once removed, kernel try to 
	  unregister data structures of bdi and delete bdi timer in kthread
	  context. But, if bdi writeback kthread is already in execution,
	  there is a probablity that that kthread trys to delete bdi timer
	  which has been deleted already. In that case, 
	  "del_timer(&wb->wakeup_timer)" code can generate kernel panic.
	  So, I add the codes which checks whether bdi is unregitered or not 
	  before removing timer.
