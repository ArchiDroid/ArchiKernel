 * (with an assert-unreachable statement) in switch statements that use

/**
 * @page page_base_user_api_gpuprops User-side Base GPU Property Query API
 *
 * The User-side Base GPU Property Query API encapsulates two
 * sub-modules:
 *
 * - @ref base_user_api_gpuprops_dyn "Dynamic GPU Properties"
 * - @ref base_plat_config_gpuprops "Base Platform Config GPU Properties"
 *
 * There is a related third module outside of Base, which is owned by the MIDG
 * module:
 * - @ref midg_gpuprops_static "Midgard Compile-time GPU Properties"
 *
 * Base only deals with properties that vary between different Midgard
 * implementations - the Dynamic GPU properties and the Platform Config
 * properties.
 *
 * For properties that are constant for the Midgard Architecture, refer to the
 * MIDG module. However, we will discuss their relevance here <b>just to
 * provide background information.</b>
 *
 * @section sec_base_user_api_gpuprops_about About the GPU Properties in Base and MIDG modules
 *
 * The compile-time properties (Platform Config, Midgard Compile-time
 * properties) are exposed as pre-processor macros.
 *
 * Complementing the compile-time properties are the Dynamic GPU
 * Properties, which act as a conduit for the Midgard Configuration
 * Discovery.
 *
 * In general, the dynamic properties are present to verify that the platform
 * has been configured correctly with the right set of Platform Config
 * Compile-time Properties.
 *
 * As a consistant guide across the entire DDK, the choice for dynamic or
 * compile-time should consider the following, in order:
 * -# Can the code be written so that it doesn't need to know the
 * implementation limits at all?
 * -# If you need the limits, get the information from the Dynamic Property
 * lookup. This should be done once as you fetch the context, and then cached
 * as part of the context data structure, so it's cheap to access.
 * -# If there's a clear and arguable inefficiency in using Dynamic Properties,
 * then use a Compile-Time Property (Platform Config, or Midgard Compile-time
 * property). Examples of where this might be sensible follow:
 *  - Part of a critical inner-loop
 *  - Frequent re-use throughout the driver, causing significant extra load
 * instructions or control flow that would be worthwhile optimizing out.
 *
 * We cannot provide an exhaustive set of examples, neither can we provide a
 * rule for every possible situation. Use common sense, and think about: what
 * the rest of the driver will be doing; how the compiler might represent the
 * value if it is a compile-time constant; whether an OEM shipping multiple
 * devices would benefit much more from a single DDK binary, instead of
 * insignificant micro-optimizations.
 *
 * @section sec_base_user_api_gpuprops_dyn Dynamic GPU Properties
 *
 * Dynamic GPU properties are presented in two sets:
 * -# the commonly used properties in @ref base_gpu_props, which have been
 * unpacked from GPU register bitfields.
 * -# The full set of raw, unprocessed properties in @ref midg_raw_gpu_props
 * (also a member of @ref base_gpu_props). All of these are presented in
 * the packed form, as presented by the GPU  registers themselves.
 *
 * @usecase The raw properties in @ref midg_raw_gpu_props are necessary to
 * allow a user of the Mali Tools (e.g. PAT) to determine "Why is this device
 * behaving differently?". In this case, all information about the
 * configuration is potentially useful, but it <b>does not need to be processed
 * by the driver</b>. Instead, the raw registers can be processed by the Mali
 * Tools software on the host PC.
 *
 * The properties returned extend the Midgard Configuration Discovery
 * registers. For example, GPU clock speed is not specified in the Midgard
 * Architecture, but is <b>necessary for OpenCL's clGetDeviceInfo() function</b>.
 *
 * The GPU properties are obtained by a call to
 * _mali_base_get_gpu_props(). This simply returns a pointer to a const
 * base_gpu_props structure. It is constant for the life of a base
 * context. Multiple calls to _mali_base_get_gpu_props() to a base context
 * return the same pointer to a constant structure. This avoids cache pollution
 * of the common data.
 *
 * This pointer must not be freed, because it does not point to the start of a
 * region allocated by the memory allocator; instead, just close the @ref
 * base_context.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_base_user_api_gpuprops_config Platform Config Compile-time Properties
 *
 * The Platform Config File sets up gpu properties that are specific to a
 * certain platform. Properties that are 'Implementation Defined' in the
 * Midgard Architecture spec are placed here.
 *
 * @note Reference configurations are provided for Midgard Implementations, such as
 * the Mali-T600 family. The customer need not repeat this information, and can select one of
 * these reference configurations. For example, VA_BITS, PA_BITS and the
 * maximum number of samples per pixel might vary between Midgard Implementations, but
 * \b not for platforms using the Mali-T604. This information is placed in
 * the reference configuration files.
 *
 * The System Integrator creates the following structure:
 * - platform_XYZ
 * - platform_XYZ/plat
 * - platform_XYZ/plat/plat_config.h
 *
 * They then edit plat_config.h, using the example plat_config.h files as a
 * guide.
 *
 * At the very least, the customer must set @ref CONFIG_GPU_CORE_TYPE, and will
 * receive a helpful \#error message if they do not do this correctly. This
 * selects the Reference Configuration for the Midgard Implementation. The rationale
 * behind this decision (against asking the customer to write \#include
 * <gpus/mali_t600.h> in their plat_config.h) is as follows:
 * - This mechanism 'looks' like a regular config file (such as Linux's
 * .config)
 * - It is difficult to get wrong in a way that will produce strange build
 * errors:
 *  - They need not know where the mali_t600.h, other_midg_gpu.h etc. files are stored - and
 *  so they won't accidentally pick another file with 'mali_t600' in its name
 *  - When the build doesn't work, the System Integrator may think the DDK is
 *  doesn't work, and attempt to fix it themselves:
 *   - For the @ref CONFIG_GPU_CORE_TYPE mechanism, the only way to get past the
 *   error is to set @ref CONFIG_GPU_CORE_TYPE, and this is what the \#error tells
 *   you.
 *   - For a \#include mechanism, checks must still be made elsewhere, which the
 *   System Integrator may try working around by setting \#defines (such as
 *   VA_BITS) themselves in their plat_config.h. In the  worst case, they may
 *   set the prevention-mechanism \#define of
 *   "A_CORRECT_MIDGARD_CORE_WAS_CHOSEN".
 *   - In this case, they would believe they are on the right track, because
 *   the build progresses with their fix, but with errors elsewhere.
 *
 * However, there is nothing to prevent the customer using \#include to organize
 * their own configurations files hierarchically.
 *
 * The mechanism for the header file processing is as follows:
 *

 * @section sec_base_user_api_gpuprops_kernel Kernel Operation
 *
 * During Base Context Create time, user-side makes a single kernel call:
 * - A call to fill user memory with GPU information structures
 *
 * The kernel-side will fill the provided the entire processed @ref base_gpu_props
 * structure, because this information is required in both
 * user and kernel side; it does not make sense to decode it twice.
 *
 * Coherency groups must be derived from the bitmasks, but this can be done
 * kernel side, and just once at kernel startup: Coherency groups must already
 * be known kernel-side, to support chains that specify a 'Only Coherent Group'
 * SW requirement, or 'Only Coherent Group with Tiler' SW requirement.
 *
 * @section sec_base_user_api_gpuprops_cocalc Coherency Group calculation
 * Creation of the coherent group data is done at device-driver startup, and so
 * is one-time. This will most likely involve a loop with CLZ, shifting, and
 * bit clearing on the L2_PRESENT or L3_PRESENT masks, depending on whether the
 * system is L2 or L2+L3 Coherent. The number of shader cores is done by a
 * population count, since faulty cores may be disabled during production,
 * producing a non-contiguous mask.
 *
 * The memory requirements for this algoirthm can be determined either by a u64
 * population count on the L2/L3_PRESENT masks (a LUT helper already is
 * requried for the above), or simple assumption that there can be no more than
 * 16 coherent groups, since core groups are typically 4 cores.
