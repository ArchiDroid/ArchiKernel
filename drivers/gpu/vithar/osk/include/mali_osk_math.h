/**
 * @brief Divide a 64-bit value with a 32-bit divider
 *
 * Performs an (unsigned) integer division of a 64-bit value 
 * with a 32-bit divider and returns the 64-bit result and
 * 32-bit remainder.
 *
 * Provided as part of the OSK as not all OSs support 64-bit
 * division in an uniform way. Currently required to support
 * printing 64-bit numbers in the OSK debug message functions.
 *
 * @param[in,out] value   pointer to a 64-bit value to be divided by
 *                        \a divisor. The integer result of the division
 *                        is stored in \a value on output.
 * @param[in]     divisor 32-bit divisor
 * @return 32-bit remainder of the division
