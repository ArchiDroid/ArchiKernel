/**
 * @addtogroup uk_api_kernel UKK (Kernel side)
 * @{
 *
 * A kernel-side device driver implements the UK interface with the help of the UKK. The UKK
 * is an OS independent API for kernel-side code to accept requests from the user-side to 
 * execute functions in the kernel-side device driver.
 *
 * A few definitions:
 * - the kernel-side device driver implementing the UK interface is called the UKK client driver
 * - the user-side library, application, or driver communicating with the UKK client driver is called the UKU client driver
 * - the UKK API implementation is called the UKK core. The UKK core is linked with your UKK client driver.
 *
 * When a UKK client driver starts it needs to initialize the UKK core by calling ukk_start() and
 * similarly ukk_stop() when the UKK client driver terminates. A UKK client driver is normally
 * started by an operating system when a device boots.
 *
 * A UKU client driver provides services that are implemented either completely in user-space, kernel-space, or
 * a combination of both. A UKU client driver makes UK calls to its UKK client driver to execute any functionality
 * of services that is implemented in kernel-space. 
 *
 * To make a UK call the UKU client driver needs to establish a connection with the UKK client driver. The UKU API 
 * provides the uku_open() call to establish this connection. Normally this results in the OS calling the open
 * entry point of the UKK client driver. Here, the UKK client driver needs to initialize a UKK session object
 * with ukk_session_init() to represent this connection, and register a function that will execute the UK calls 
 * requested over this connection (or UKK session). This function is called the UKK client dispatch handler. 
 *
 * To prevent the UKU client driver executing an incompatible UK call implementation, the UKK session object  
 * stores the version of the UK calls supported by the function registered to execute the UK calls. As soon as the 
 * UKU client driver established a connection with the UKK client driver, uku_open() makes an internal UK call to 
 * request the version of the UK calls supported by the UKK client driver and will fail if the version expected
 * by the UKU client driver is not compatible with the version supported by the UKK client driver. Internal UK calls
 * are handled by the UKK core itself and don't reach the UKK client dispatch handler.
 *
 * Once the UKU client driver has established a (compatible) connection with the UKK client driver, the UKU
 * client driver can execute UK calls by using uku_call(). This normally results in the OS calling the ioctl 
 * handler of your UKK client driver and presenting it with the UK call argument structure that was passed
 * to uku_call(). It is the responsibility of the ioctl handler to copy the UK call argument structure from
 * user-space to kernel-space and provide it to the UKK dispatch function, ukk_dispatch(), for execution. Depending
 * on the particular UK call, the UKK dispatch function will either call the UKK client dispatch handler associated
 * with the UKK session, or the UKK core dispatch handler if it is an UK internal call. When the UKK dispatch
 * function returns, the return code of the UK call and the output and input/output parameters in the UK call argument
 * structure will have been updated. Again, it is the responsibility of the ioctl handler to copy the updated
 * UK call argument structure from kernel-space back to user-space.
 *
 * When the UKK client dispatch handler is called it is passed the UK call argument structure (along with a
 * UK call context which is discussed later). The UKK client dispatch handler uses the uk_header structure in the
 * UK call argument structure (which is always the first member in this structure) to determine which UK call in
 * particular needs to be executed. The uk_header structure is a union of a 32-bit number containing the UK call 
 * function number (as defined by the UKK client driver) and a mali_error return value that will store the return
 * value of the UK call. The 32-bit UK call function number is normally used to select a particular case in a switch
 * statement that implements the particular UK call which finally stores the result of the UK call in the mali_error
 * return value of the uk_header structure.
 *
 * A UK call implementation is provided with access to a number of objects it may need during the UK call through
 * a UKK call context. This UKK call context currently only contains
 *   - a pointer to the UKK session for the UK call
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the ioctl handler to initialize a UKK call context using ukk_call_prepare() and pass
 * it on to the UKK dispatch function. The UK call implementation then uses ukk_session_get() to retrieve the stored
 * objects in the UKK call context. The UK call implementation normally uses the UKK session pointer returned from
 * ukk_session_get() to access the UKK client driver's context in which the UKK session is embedded. For example:
 *	struct kbase_context {
 *          int some_kbase_context_data;
 *          int more_kbase_context_data;
 *          ukk_session ukk_session_member;
 *      } *kctx;
 *	kctx = CONTAINER_OF(ukk_session_get(ukk_call_ctx), kbase_context, ukk_session_member);
 *
 * A UK call may not use an argument structure with embedded pointers.
 *
 * All of this can be translated into the following minimal sample code for a UKK client driver:
@code
